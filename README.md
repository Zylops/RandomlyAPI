# RandomlyAPI!

So after literally the second episode of Corey's flask series, I tried to do something of my own, and here it is. It is in no way original or good but I made it I mean cmon what do ya expect? Once again, if you wanna learn flask, check out corey I beg you: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwZwr5Tvyxo&list=PL-osiE80TeTs4UjLw5MM6OjgkjFeUxCYH

It's an API for randomized stuff, numbers, letters, words etc.
